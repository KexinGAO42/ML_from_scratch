# Data

- Are there external datasets? -> Discover or integrate data.
- Have data generation methods? -> Generate data.

## Data Collection

- Identify existing datasets
- Find bencmark datasets to evaluate a new idea
- Collect new data

### Popular ML datasets

- MNIST: written digits
- ImageNet: millions of images from image search engines
- AudioSet: YouTube sound clips for sound classification
- Kinetics: YouTube videos clips for action classification
- KITTI: traffic scenarios recorded by cameras and other sensors
- Amazon Review: customer reviews from Amazon online 
- SQuAD: qustion-answer pairs derived from Wikipediaa
- LibriSpeech: 1000 hours of audiobooks

## Data Integration (SQL)

- Combine data from multiple sources into a coerent dataset
- Product data is often stored in multiple tables
- Join tables by keys, which are often entity IDs
- Key issues: 
  - identify IDs
  - missing rows
  - redundant columns
  - value conflicts

## Data Generation

- Data synthesizing
  - Use GANs to generate pictures
- Data augmentations (To Be Completed)
  - Image
  - Text
    - Back translation (English -> French -> English) https://amitness.com

## Web Scraping

- Web crawling （网页爬取）: indxing whole pages on Internet
- Web scraping （网页数据提取）: scraping particulaar data from web pages of a website

### Method

- Use headless browers (selenium package)
- Use lots of new IPs (get through public clouds)
  - IPv4 IPs, AWS 1.75%, Azure 0.55%, GCP 0.25% generate random IP (several dollars per IP)

### Practice - house price prediction based on Zillow data

- Get the house IDs from the index pages (BeautifulSoup)
- Identify the HTML elements through Inspect (pandas.from_html)
- Extract data (id, address, sold price, sold on...)
- Cost: AWS EC2 t3.small; cost to crawl 1M houses is $16.6
- Legal consideration: isn't illegal at US
  - SHOULD NOT scrape data have sensitive information (private dataa involving usernam/password; personal information)
  - SHOULD NOT scrape copyrighted data (Youtube videos / Fliker photos)
  - SHOULD follow ther Terms of Service that explicitly prohibits web scraping
  - SHOULD consult a lawyer if scraping for profit

## Data Labeling

### Semi-supervised Learning

scenarios where there is a small amount of labeled data, along with large amout of unlabeled data

- Assumptions
  - Continuity assumption: examples with similar features are more likely to have the same label
  - Cluster assumption: data have inherent cluster structure, examples in the same cluster tend to have the same label
  - Manifold assumption: the data lie on a manifold of much lower dimension than  the input space
- Self-training

### Label through Crowdsourcing (active learning)

- Challenges

  - Simplifier user interation: design easy task, clear instructions, simple to use interface
  - Find qualified workers for complex jobs
  - Cost: reduce #tasks * #time per task sent to labelers
  - Quality control: label qualities generated by different lables vary

- Method

  - Reduce #tasks: **active learning** (SSL with human intervention)
    - Select the most "interesting" unlabeld data to labelers
    - Uncertainty sampling: exaamples with prediction most uncertain
    - Query-by-committee: trains multiple models and performs major voting

  - Quality control:
    - multiple labelers on same tasks and determine the label by majority voting
    - Prune low-quality labelers by testing

### SSL + Active learning

### Weak supervision (No label, no money for crowd-sourcing)

- Semi-automatically generate labels: less acurate than manual ones, but good enough for training
- Data programming: heuristic programs to asssign labels
  - Keyword search, pattern matching, third-party models
